Each chapter includes hundreds of interactive tasks designed to help you take your first steps in learning Chinese with confidence.

Completion statuses are shown for each section.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766158559146/126837fd-0786-476d-b643-1eed59e87814.png)

## How Does the New A1 Professional Chinese Curriculum Work?

In this A1 Professional Chinese Curriculum, you'll learn the building blocks of the Chinese language. This will follow the A1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). And we've focused on vocabulary that is particularly useful for professional settings.

The curriculum is broken down into several modules that include warm-up, learning, practice, review pages, and quizzes to make sure that you truly understand the material before moving onto the next module.

The **Warm-up** serves as preparation and provides context for the main content of the module.

The tasks in the warm-up will either introduce you to new vocabulary for the first time, or review content you have already learned that will be used in the current module.

Below is an example of what you will find in the lessons.

![An illustration of a person in a striped sweater appears in a virtual classroom set in a modern office. Text at the top reads, "Remember that a syllable has three parts: an initial, a final, and a tone? A change in any of these parts can represent a completely different character." A speech bubble shows the text "nǐ hǎo" with Chinese characters.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766158665243/cb5a3d23-3626-4b12-aae0-829a3db7b7cf.png)

Each task will have an accompanying question that will help you practice the content. If you don’t know how to answer a question or need more details, you can check the explanation section.

![7e6f988c-9bf7-454c-afaa-091920ff5a02](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764863508777/7e6f988c-9bf7-454c-afaa-091920ff5a02.png)

After the **Warm-up**, you'll head over to **Learn**. This is where you'll see the new words you've learned in action! You'll listen to short sections of monologues or dialogues and answer questions about them to make sure you understand their meaning and how they're used in real conversations. This is also where you’ll learn some theory when needed.

Text above explains how to introduce nationality in Chinese using "wǒ shì + nationality," with a caption below showing the character saying, "I am Chinese" in both Pinyin and simplified Chinese characters.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766158808549/5a1b2945-149a-433b-a840-cff49224908c.png)

The curriculum also has fill-in-the-blank questions that will help you practice writing using **Pinyin** and **Hanzi**.

![An animated character with a backpack stands in an office with a living wall and computers. Chinese text and transliteration are displayed, saying: "我是新加坡人。" Below, there's a fill-in-the-blank activity related to the sentence.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766158976101/208a38c7-850d-4d43-8794-c6c51fc92962.png)

After **Learn**, you'll move on to **Practice** where you'll complete more open-ended tasks that test your comprehension and your ability to write using Pinyin and Hanzi.

The phrases need to be placed in blanks next to "wáng huá" and other prompts.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766159066500/9b4b962d-dcd8-4782-9526-07a4cc5e0219.png)

At the end of each module, there is a **Review** section with grammar highlights and a glossary of the main points and concepts covered. You can use these review pages to help you study for the quizzes.

![This image contains text titled "Grammar Highlights" discussing types of greetings in Chinese. It introduces three phrases: "你好" (nǐ hǎo) for casual use, "您好" (nín hǎo) for polite interactions, and "你们好" (nǐ men hǎo) for greeting groups.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766097053581/bc30af81-4d64-42b2-84d5-624d9c3f87db.png)

The last portion of the module is the **Quiz**. Quizzes are designed to test your understanding from the material covered in the module.

Throughout the certification, each chapter will have these quizzes. You’ll need to complete them in order to qualify for the exam at the end of the certification.

![A quiz titled "Greetings and Introductions Quiz" tests understanding of basic Chinese greetings. To pass, at least 9 out of 10 questions must be answered correctly. The first question asks which phrase to use when greeting a group of people, with options including "nǐ men hǎo" (你们好), "nín hǎo" (您好), "wǒ shì" (我是), and "nǐ hǎo" (你好).](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766162326716/7f0a788e-5f9b-4b3b-8499-1cd39eca1d37.png)

The certification exam will be the final item released for this certification. We are currently publishing the first three chapters, and future chapters will be released progressively as they are developed by our instructional design team. Once all the chapters are available, we will release the certification exam.

### What are the letters and numbers beside the curriculum names? (For example: A1, A2, B1)

These labels refer to the CEFR levels, which is an international framework used to describe language proficiency. A1 and A2 represent beginner levels, B1 and B2 represent intermediate levels, and C1 and C2 represent advanced levels. Each level indicates the skills and knowledge you are expected to have at that stage of your language learning journey.

![Graphic titled “CEFR Levels Explained” showing the six CEFR language proficiency levels from A1 to C2. A1 is described as communicating with help from the listener. A2 involves communicating in a limited range of contexts. B1 focuses on communicating essential points in familiar contexts. B2 involves communicating with some fluency in a range of contexts. C1 emphasizes flexible and fluent communication in many contexts. C2 represents precise and sensitive communication in most contexts.
