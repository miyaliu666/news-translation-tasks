Joe taught himself programming for 4 years while working as a janitor. As the single father of two Autistic boys, he first used his programming skills to build an iPad app to help them learn how to talk.

We talk about:

-   The role of soft skills in getting things done in big organizations
    
-   The need for patience and practice in self-teaching
    
-   How to stop jumping from one tool to another and to instead go deep
