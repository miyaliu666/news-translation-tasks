But did you know that the journey of AI chatbots began way back in 1966 with ELIZA? ELIZA was not as sophisticated as today’s models like GPT, but it marked the beginning of the exciting path that led us to where we are now.

Language is the essence of human interaction, and in the digital age, teaching machines to understand and generate language has become a cornerstone of artificial intelligence.

The models we interact with today—such as GPT, Llama3, Gemini, and Claude—are known as Large Language Models (LLMs). This is because they are trained on vast datasets of text, enabling them to perform a wide range of language-related tasks.

But what exactly are LLMs, and why is there so much hype surrounding them?

In this article, you'll learn what LLMs are and what is the hype all about.

## **What Are LLMs?**

Large Language Models are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are based on deep learning architectures like transformers, which allow them to process and predict text in a way that mimics human understanding.

In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been trained on many examples to differentiate between an apple and a Boeing 787 – and to be able to describe each of them.

Before they're ready for use and can answer your questions, LLMs are trained on massive datasets. Realistically, a program cannot conclude anything from a single sentence. But after analyzing, say, trillions of sentences, it's able to build a logic to complete sentences or even generate its own.

### How to Train an LLM

Here’s how the training process works:

1.  **Data Collection:** The first step involves gathering millions (or even billions) of text documents from diverse sources, including books, websites, research papers, and social media. This extensive dataset serves as the foundation for the model’s learning process.
   
2.  **Learning Patterns:** The model analyzes the collected data to identify and learn patterns in the text. These patterns include grammar rules, word associations, contextual relationships, and even some level of common sense. By processing this data, the model begins to understand how language works.
   
3.  **Fine-Tuning:** After the initial training, the model is fine-tuned for specific tasks. This involves adjusting the model’s parameters to optimize its performance for tasks such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, or question-answering.
   
4.  **Evaluation and Testing:** Once trained, the model is rigorously tested against a series of benchmarks to evaluate its accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. This step ensures that the model performs well in real-world applications.
   

After the training process is completed, the models are heavily tested on a series of benchmarks for accuracy, efficiency, security, and so on.

## **Applications of LLMs**

LLMs have a wide range of applications, from content generation to prediction and a lot more.

# Get your token from -> https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
os.environ["REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"] = "TOKEN"
api = replicate.Client(api_token=os.environ["REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"])

# Running llama3 model using replicate
output = api.run(
    "meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct",
        input={"prompt": 'Hey how are you?'}
    )

# Printing llama3's response
for item in output:
    print(item, end="")
