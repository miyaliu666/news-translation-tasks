On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview Tae'lur Alexis. She's a developer and security analyst. Instead of going to college, Tae'lur spent years working various fast food and retail jobs.

<!-- more -->

Tae'lur taught herself Python and JavaScript using freeCodeCamp and worked as a software engineer for 5 years before specializing in security engineering. Now instead of building applications, she breaks them.

We talk about:

-   Making ends meet working McDonalds in Florida
    
-   How she taught herself programming using freeCodeCamp and the #100DaysOfCode challenge
    
-   Leveraging local meetups to make developer friends
    
-   Moving to Thailand and working remotely
    

You can watch the interview on YouTube:
